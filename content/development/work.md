# **This is** what I do

I'm a web developer by trade. My 9-5 is currently spent as a front-end dev for Each & Other – a UX design and digital transformation agency in Dublin city. Back in 2006 I finished up a degree in Software Development in my home town of Galway, at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, or GMIT. Since then I've bounced between the east and west coasts of Ireland, but settled in Dublin around 2012.

## Current __tech stack__

**JavaScript** has been my main focus the past few years. I've built applications with Ember and React, and a smaller scale application with Angular via Ionic. The latter was for a hybrid Android app you can find on the <a href="./projects">Projects page</a>. Previous to using JavaScript _properly_, jQuery was king for most projects and provided an easier entry into using JS on a day to day basis.

I've been using __CSS__ since about 1999. I'm very comfortable with it. I love using it to bring pages to life with micro-interactions and fluid UI animations. CSS is easy to use, but hard to use well. It's very satisfying when you build something from the ground up with it, which scales well and stays clean.
