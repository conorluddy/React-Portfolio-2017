# **About** this site

I haven't had my own website in quite a few years, so I thought it was about time I made a fresh one. It's a good excuse to learn some new tech, and practice some design while I'm at it.

Interested in how it works? Read on...



## Under the hood

In a nutshell, this is a single-page, static site, built from the ground up using React and React Router. Locally I use Node, with Webpack to transpile my JavaScript from ES6 to ES5 and bundle it up into a single file, and Gulp to take care of the other tooling. Other tooling being everything from generating new component stubs, to running BrowserSync, to linting my code, to generating a site tree from local MarkDown files. Still interested? Great!
