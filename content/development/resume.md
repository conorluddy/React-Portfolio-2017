## Conor Luddy
### Software Engineer at Hudson's Bay Company

conorluddy@gmail.com


I'm a front-end developer from Galway, working in web development professionally since 2006, and dabbling in it since before 2000. I hold a BSc (Hons) in Software Development from GMIT in Galway, Ireland. I'm mostly interested in working on RESTful Node/Javascript stacks, with any of the current leading frameworks. Over the past few years I've built things in Ember, Vue, React and Angular that are now being used in the wild. I also have a strong interest in graphic and web design and regularly take on freelance design work. When I'm not glued to a screen I enjoy a spot of photography and videography. You can find more info on all of the above on my website at www.conorluddy.com


# Work __Experience__

## Software Engineer at Hudson's Bay Company / Gilt

June 2017 - Present

I joined Gilt in Dublin in June 2017, mostly to get a change from the previous 5 years of agency
work and see what it's like to work on a product instead. HBC acquired Gilt in 2016, and also own Saks Fifth Avenue and several other department store chains. The development work is a balance of Gilt stack and Saks stack, primarily on the front-end. We work on agile transatlantic teams and talk to our counterparts in New York on the daily. My first trip to NYC was also with HBC.
This is my first time working with a microservices architecture. It's been very interesting and
educational so far, and I find it an excellent way to work. We've begun building applications with Vue.js, to replace the older React stack, and enjoy leveraging server-side rendering and cutting- edge techniques to provide our end users with a rapid, responsive and seamless experience,
and our developers with a DRY cross-banner framework for optimal reusability of themeable UI components.
One particularly interesting thing I worked on here involved server-side rendering an application
with Webpack and VueJs, but keeping the client side as vanilla, transpiled ES6, so that it was as lightweight as possible.
This is starting to sound like a sales/recruitment pitch, so I'll end it with some keywords regarding
the tech I've been working with:

Freelance Designer/Developer January 2000 - Present
Over the years I've gained a useful level of graphic/web design, photography and video production skills. These work well with my development skills and allow me to offer a solid range of services to clients. I only take on extra work like this occasionally, and only if it’s for something that interests me and something that I can comfortably fit into my free time. I edited video when working as a developer for Each & Other in 2014 and it helped to win us a major contract with Google.
Visual software I’m very comfortable with includes: Adobe Illustrator Adobe Photoshop Adobe Lightroom Adobe Premier Pro Adobe After Effects Sketch
Web Developer at Each & Other August 2012 - May 2017 (4 years 10 months)
Each & Other are a UX design consultancy with a small development team of 5. We work solo or in teams, on-site or off-site depending on the projects at hand. I began working for IQ Content in 2012, but they reformed as Each & Other two years ago. The agency work here provides a very

fast moving and dynamic workload, allowing me to try new things with each new project and keep up to date with the ever-evolving world of web development.
Web Developer at Buy4Now July 2011 - August 2012 (1 year 2 months)
Buy4now are based in Sandyford and offer e-commerce software as a service. Since I left there
in 2012 they were acquired by MyWebGrocer. They provide a C#/.Net based solution and handle the online stores of many of Ireland’s largest retailers, including SuperQuinn, Woodies, PC World, Arnotts and Three.
I was hired here as a full stack developer after gaining some .Net experience in my previous job in
Aro. I enjoyed Buy4now but the work was repetitive and I didn’t feel like I was learning enough.
My stay here was relatively brief after I discovered IQ Content and applied for a position there instead, based on their attractive and varied portfolio and their central location in Dublin city.
Skills involved: - CSS (SASS) - HTML/ASP - JavaScript - jQuery - C# - MS SQL Server
Web Developer/Designer at Aró Internet Business Development September 2009 - July 2011 (1 year 11 months)
Aró are based in Connemara in Galway, and while I was with them their primary business was
designing and building hotel websites. This was my first real web development position and it’s where I found my love for the craft. Aró was a full stack affair with plenty of graphic design work on top. The back end involved .Net and MSSQL development, and the front end was standard front end work, chopping up PSD’s into pixel perfect websites. Even in IE6.
Skills involved: - CSS - HTML/ASP - JavaScript - jQuery - MooTools - C# - MS SQL Server

Software Engineer at Fintrax November 2007 - September 2009 (1 year 11 months)
Fintrax are based in Connemara, Galway, and provided point of sales terminals for businesses that
helped tourists to avail of tax free shopping. While I was working here I spent much of my time travelling around the country to install the physical units into hotels and stores. This often involved setting up routers and WiFi for them to communicate over. C++ was the main language here but the job involved a lot more testing and installation than it did coding.
Software Developer at Trust5 September 2006 - November 2007 (1 year 3 months)
My software development career began with Trust5 in Sandyford. This was pre-Android and iOS
and we used to manage mobile game and ringtone downloads for clients such as O2. My position here involved testing our content delivery portals on various mobile devices, as well as managing uploads and customer support for that content. Code experience here was light, but involved MS SQL, VB.Net, and some CSS and HTML.
