# **This is** what I do

I'm a web developer by trade. My 9-5 is currently spent as a front-end engineer for <a href="http://www.eachandother.com/people.html" target="_blank" >Each & Other</a> – a UX design and digital transformation agency in Dublin city. Back in 2006 I finished up a degree in Software Development in my home town of Galway, at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, or GMIT. Since then I've bounced between the east and west coasts of Ireland, but settled in Dublin around 2012.


## Current __tech stack__

I've been using __CSS__ since about 1999. I'm very comfortable with it. I love using it to bring pages to life with micro-interactions and fluid UI animations. CSS is like crayons. Anyone can use it, but it takes a bit of skill and practice to do anything useful with it.

__JavaScript__ has been my main focus over the past few years. I've built applications with __Ember__ and __React__, and a smaller scale application with __Angular__ and __Ionic__. The latter was for a hybrid Android app you can find on the <a href="./projects">side projects page</a>. Prior to using JavaScript properly, __jQuery__ was king for most projects and gave me a nice ramp-up into using front-end JavaScript on a day-to-day basis. I use __Node__ and __NPM__ daily to handle tooling for any projects I'm working on, with __Gulp__ as a task runner. __Github__ is my preferred method of version control. The __AWS__ suite of cloud services is pretty awesome for all things cloud, and I completed the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/essentials/" target="_blank" >AWS Technical Essentials</a> day course last November to get a better understanding of how it can be leveraged.


## __Recent__ Projects

## __SSE__ Airtricity

In 2015 I led the front-end development of SSE's responsive website rebuild. I set up an extensive build environment with Node and Gulp, then laid out a scaffold for a componentised front-end using SASS, with specific guidelines and rules about how we should keep the front-end codebase clean and scalable. The project is still being built upon today, and generates a living style-guide on the fly as you build new components. This year I was working on-site with SSE again for a few months, on their agile digital team.

## __IOT project__

This was a very interesting IoT project aimed at saving energy in large offices by using intelligent lighting. We built a single page application with Ember, D3, and Leaflet. The rest is confidential, but it was awesome. It took up most of my work year in 2016.

## __Oireachtas__ Éireann

The new Oireachtas website is still in beta, and is due to go live this summer. I spent a few months working on parts of the front-end of this in early 2017.
