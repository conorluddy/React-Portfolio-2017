# __Web__ design // development

These are small selection of projects I've worked on over the last few years.
Web development is my full-time day job, and has been for over 10 years now.
The design side of it started out as a personal hobby that ended up turning into
something useful. Having an interest in design comes in useful very often when
you're a developer.




## __Irish Drift__ Championship

When I got my first DSLR camera about 7 years ago, I ended up under the wing of
a car enthusiast blog called <a href="http://freshfix.ie/" target="\_blank">Freshfix</a>. We
would cover drifting events, which meant I'd get to go out on to the actual
track during events and shoot <a href="https://vimeo.com/70743331" target="\_blank">the action</a>
up close. I ended up making loads of connections after a few years of this, and soon after I'd
<a href=https://www.behance.net/gallery/7180623/Web-Design-Development-Freshfixnet target="\_blank" >re-designed and re-built the old Freshfix website</a>,
I was asked if I'd be up for designing and building the first ever Irish Drift
Championship website. The guys running the IDC have really built it into something
insane since then and I'd recommend <a href="https://www.idcnation.com" target="\_blank">checking it out</a>.
The site I built was since retired, but it served its purpose well for the first couple of years.

- Responsive website – Works seamlessly across mobile, tablet and desktop
- Bespoke design – designed by me with Adobe Photoshop
- Wordpress theme – Built as lightweight as possible from the ground up
- LiveStream feed at events reached over 50k people at peak times
- Driver profiles pages for 100+ drivers, with filters and search

## __Prodrift__ Academy

The Irish Drift Championship was formerly known as Prodrift. These guys kept the
brand alive and run a drifting school out of Mondello. I designed and built them
a <a href="http://prodriftacademy.ie/" target="\_blank">website</a> in 2013.
The site is still in use today, 4 years later, and was also cloned for the
<a href="http://www.prodriftacademysa.com/" target="\_blank" >school they've set
up in Dubal</a>. I was also hired for a few of the drift sessions to handle
photography to be used for their social media and for their students, as well as
for certain parts of the website at the time.

## __Liberty__ Insurance

Liberty hired a small team of us to design and build their current website. I was the
front-end developer for the project, so I built the front-end [CSS, JavaScript, HTML]
of their current website. The design aspect was left to the professionals this
time.
